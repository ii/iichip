# iichip
Fork me and deploy this code as an image to a C.H.I.P via a browser

```feature
Scenario: Fork this repo! Run code on your CHIP! Never leave browser!

In order to help work on the next #opensource idea to change the world
As a non-technical user on a chrome browser
I want to easily make changes to code and run it on real hardware

Given I have made a fork of a CHIP project I'm interested in
When I make some changes to the code via a browser
Then I will see some instructions for connecting my CHIP for flashing
And I will quickly be running the modified software on my CHIP
```
